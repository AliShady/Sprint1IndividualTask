        PARASITE
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>A great man once said:
          <q>Drop the SE course.</q> Team Parasite consists of members who chose, although with some regrets, not to. It was
          formed in February 2018, as the product of many voluntary and involuntary decisions. Some say that it was randomness
          that brought us together; others claim that they had carefully planned tutorial transfers, but no one knows for
          sure. In the end, you can find all types of people among us: There are those who care about efficiency and algorithms,
          others who side with teamwork and fairness, and yet others who will probably care about none of the above. It is
          quite normal and acceptable. Some value diligence and dedication; others value their rights to some freedom and
          flexibility. Then, there will always come someone who would say: The ultimate goal is to pass the course, or is
          it not? And many who would rightfully ask: How could balance be achieved? Regardless, as our views clash and as
          we experience the good and bad of cooperation and competition, we will strive as a team to achieve the best we
          can reach. And it is perhaps in this intention, polished by its naivete and many fallacies, that one could find
          some light in our chaotic microcosm.</p>
